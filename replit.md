# AI Daily Newsletter Generator

## Overview

An automated daily newsletter system that collects AI and technology news from 10 trusted sources, intelligently consolidates duplicate stories using TF-IDF similarity matching, generates AI-powered summaries via OpenAI, and distributes beautifully formatted newsletters through SendFox email at 7 AM daily. The system includes a Streamlit web interface for manual triggers, newsletter archives, and real-time status monitoring.

## System Architecture

### Application Structure

**Framework**: Python-based system with Streamlit web interface
- Modular component architecture with single-responsibility classes
- Background scheduler using threading for daily automation
- JSON-based persistence for newsletter storage

  - CTA buttons interspersed between story categories
  - Consistent footer with branding and generation date

**Email Distribution** (`sendfox_client.py`)
- SendFox API integration for campaign creation
- Campaign sending to subscriber lists
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Scheduling System** (`scheduler.py`)
- Schedule library for daily 7 AM newsletter generation
- Threaded execution to avoid blocking web interface
- Automatic workflow orchestration (scrape → deduplicate → summarize → generate → send)
- Thread-safe coordination with manual workflows via shared lock
- Currently uses default newsletter configuration (future: support multiple configs)

**Data Persistence** (`database.py`)
- JSON file-based storage (`newsletters.json`)
- Newsletter archiving with metadata
- Automatic backup creation before saves
- Retrieval methods for archive browsing

**Web Interface** (`app.py`)
- Streamlit dashboard with real-time metrics
- Manual newsletter generation with progress tracking
- Dual export functionality: HTML and Markdown formats for both new and archived newsletters
- Archive browser for historical newsletters with view and download options
- RSS Feed Management page for adding, editing, deleting, and toggling news sources
- Category Management page for creating and maintaining custom story categories
- Configuration panel for API status
- Backward compatibility for archived newsletters (markdown available for new newsletters only)

**Feed Management** (`feed_manager.py`, `feeds.json`)
- JSON-based storage for RSS feed configuration
- CRUD operations: add, update, delete, toggle enable/disable
- Feed categorization (Tech News, Research, AI Industry, Business, Other)
- Dynamic feed loading - scraper automatically reloads when feeds change
- Backup system for feed configuration safety

**Category Management** (`category_manager.py`, `categories.json`)
- JSON-based storage for newsletter categories with priority, emoji, and enabled status
- CRUD operations: add, edit, delete, toggle enable/disable, reorder by priority
- Default categories: AI Policy, AI Business, AI Research, AI Products, Machine Learning, Robotics, Tech Industry, Other
- Priority-based ordering (1-998 for custom categories, 999 reserved for "Other")
- Dynamic category loading - summarizer automatically reloads when categories change
- Inline editing with emoji support and priority management
- "Other" category protected from deletion and always appears last
- Backup system for category configuration safety

**Newsletter Configuration Management** (`newsletter_config.py`, `newsletter_configs.json`)
- Multiple newsletter configurations with independent settings
- Each config specifies: name, description, selected feeds, selected categories, max stories
- Empty feed/category lists default to "use all enabled" for central management flexibility
- CRUD operations: add, update, delete, toggle enable/disable
- Schedule settings per newsletter (time, enabled/disabled)
- Generate page allows selecting which newsletter config to use
- Database tracks config_id and config_name for each generated newsletter
- Archive view displays which config was used for each newsletter
- Backup system for configuration safety
- Thread-safe generation via shared lock with scheduler
- Full branding customization per newsletter:
  - Custom logo upload (PNG/JPG) stored in attached_assets directory
  - Header background color customization via color picker
  - Header text color customization via color picker
  - Header font selection (Arial, Georgia, Courier, Verdana, Times New Roman)

  - All branding settings applied dynamically during newsletter generation
- Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons customization:
  - 3 customizable CTA buttons per newsletter
  - Each button has text and link properties
  - Buttons styled with header text color from branding
  - Empty buttons automatically hidden from display
  - Buttons appear centered between stories and footer

**Shared Resources** (`shared_resources.py`)
- Persistent threading lock for newsletter generation coordination
- Survives Streamlit reruns (unlike module-level locks in app.py)
- Serializes manual and scheduled newsletter runs to prevent concurrent execution
- Protects database writes and SendFox API sends from race conditions
- Both app.py and scheduler.py import and use the same lock instance

### Data Flow

1. **Scheduled/Manual Trigger** → Initiates workflow
2. **Scraping** → Collects articles from 10 RSS feeds (limited to 15 most recent for performance)
3. **Deduplication** → Identifies and consolidates similar stories using TF-IDF/cosine similarity
4. **Summarization** → Generates AI summaries, scores, and categories via OpenAI (top 15 stories)
5. **Newsletter Generation** → Creates HTML, Markdown, and text versions (top 12 by impact score)
6. **Persistence** → Saves to JSON database with all formats
7. **Distribution** → Sends via SendFox email API
8. **Display** → Available in web interface archive with dual export options

### Key Design Patterns

**Singleton Components**: Components cached via `@st.cache_resource` for efficient resource usage

**Background Threading**: Scheduler runs in daemon thread to enable concurrent web interface operation

**Thread Safety**: Shared lock module prevents concurrent newsletter generation
- Lock in shared_resources.py persists across Streamlit reruns
- Both manual and scheduled workflows coordinate via the same lock instance
- Non-blocking acquisition (blocking=False) with user-friendly warnings
- Proper cleanup with finally blocks ensures lock release

**Parameter Passing**: No shared state mutation for thread safety
- Scraper accepts custom_sources parameter (avoids mutating self.sources)
- Summarizer accepts custom_categories parameter (avoids mutating self.categories)
- Each newsletter config generates with isolated feed/category lists

**Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality when APIs unavailable (logs warnings, uses fallbacks)

**Modular Pipeline**: Each processing stage is independent and replaceable
